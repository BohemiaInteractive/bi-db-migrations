FS structure:
```bash
../
  src/
    <table-name>/
      schema.sql
      data.sql
  <migration-version>.sql #migration procedure per software release
  ...
```

`migrations/src` folder contains source files the migration procedure (`<migration-version>.sql`) is generated from.  
The generation of `<migration-version.sql>` happens only at the time of new software release and does NOT happen when the actual migration procedure is initiated.  

To migrate the software to the newest version, run:

```bash
project/root> ./node_modules/.bin/bi-service migrate
```

The command above will try to fetch current state of a database from `migrations` table and will execute migration procedures for versions larger than the current state in the `migrations` table.  
If the `migrations` table does not exist, the table will be created automaticatly and all migration procedures will be run in correct order.
